//WHAT STILL TO DO
-manual refresh only when clicking the specific direction area (box)
-switch the box order based on the datetime, in the afternoon the way from work to home should be at the top
-adapt the duration to schottentor based on the datetime - get the durations from wiener linien, at least approx
-at the bottom of every time there could be a small waiting time in minutes
-switch to real api data, do not use mocks anymore
-deploy to nextbim.ivanburda.com
